 Andhra Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (APSCSCL) operates a vast network of warehouses and transportation infrastructure for the procurement, storage, and distribution of essential commodities under the Public Distribution System (PDS). With the increasing scale and complexity of operations, there is a growing need to adopt advanced technologies to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency across supply chain processes. One of the key opportunities identified lies in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and video analytics to harness the potential of existing CCTV infrastructure deployed across warehouses. AI-driven solutions can help automate critical operational tasks such as inventory verification, vehicle tracking, access control, and real-time monitoring, significantly reducing manual errors and enhancing security. To explore innovative, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, APSCSCL is organizing a Hackathon aimed at engaging startups, incubators, research institutions, and technology experts. The objective is to identify and pilot AI-based video (CCTV feed) analytics solutions for real-world use cases observed in APSCSCL warehouses and other godowns. Successful prototypes from this Hackathon will be considered for further development and deployment through formal engagements with APSCSCL.
